This project is a simple static website created as part of a web development assignment. It demonstrates the use of Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and layout structure. The site represents a fictional local pool cleaning company based in Pomona, California — “Pomona Pool Pros.”

The goal of the project is to showcase Bootstrap components such as a jumbotron, cards, forms, footers, and navigation bars, all organized across four distinct pages.
